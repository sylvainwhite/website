In its service to health, Osteopathy defines the role of the therapist as assisting
the natural process of self-healing inherent in the patient's body in order to 
help restore health, increase vitality and maintain a state of well-being. 

The body has the ability to heal itself. To do this, the joints and vital organs must be able to move freely. Likewise the circulation, so that this natural process
can restore health. 

This global approach to being, focuses on the cause rather than a symptom because the symptom is merely a sign put in place by the body when its balance is disturbed. The hands-on techniques used aim at restoring the circulation in the whole body, nervous system, articular,  blood, visceral, etc.
